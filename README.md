### Hello! I am Sera Bostan 👋

I am currently working at Yaya Labs where we have a humanoid robot called Desdemona 🤖 ( or we call her Desi ) that is powered by AI for leveraging creativity in the entertainment sector! Desi is a going to be a popstar touring the world, and making collaborations with musical atrists to expand the music insdustry and push the unseen boundaries ✨


As part of my postgrad journey in Neurotechnolgy stream, I have started using Pyhton, and have worked with some of my classmates to decode neural activity of a monkey using ✨Deep Learning✨! I also did some Reinforcement Learning projects previously as part of my module :)

During my undergrad, MATLAB was the main programme I have used to complete statistical analysis 📊 and for EEG feature extraction/classification projects 🧠.
Recently,  I have used it for investigating how humans adapt to horizontal arm movements in an unknown field (pretty cool☺). 🦾

### What I'm focusing on now: 🧘‍♀️
I am working on building my own chatbot which can generate images also (I know it's already out there, but I just want to know the process of making one so, here we are!! :D)
For Chatbot, I am using Llama-3; and for image generation, Stable Diffusion v1.5 as I have low RAM on my laptop :) Using OpenWebUI, I will intergrate both and make a user-firendly chatbot that can be used by anyone!

### My Goal is 🏆
to finsih chatbot project
and then play around with speech recognition and computer vision models later on:
