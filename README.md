### Hello! I am Sera Bostan 👋

I am currently doing my Master's in Biomedical Engineering (Neurotechnology)🧠 at Imperial College London! 

I have started using Pyhton about 6 months ago, and currently I am working with my team to decode neural activity of a monkey using ✨Deep Learning✨! I also did some Reinforcement Learning projects previously as part of my module :)

During my undergrad, MATLAB was the main programme I have used to complete statistical analysis 📊 and for EEG feature extraction/classification projects.
Recently,  I have used it for investigating how humans adapt to horizontal arm movements in an unknown field (pretty cool☺). 🦾

### What I'm focusing on now: 🧘‍♀️
Well, exams at the moment really (a big sigh 😮‍💨). 
But at the same time, me and my team are trying to improve our code for neural decoding competition and eventually write a report about it. 
This summer, I am planning on doing online coding programmes once I finish my thesis! 

### My Goal is 🏆
to spend more time to start new projects and improve my coding :) (also getting better at usin GitHub!)
